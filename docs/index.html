                <p>Programming can be difficult sometimes, and there isn't always an online tutorial to help. That's why I've decided to start creating pages explaining my most recent projects, and how to go about making your own version as well. This page will try to provide insight on how to program <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids" target="_blank">Boids.</a></p>
                <p>Boids is an artificial life simulation. When done right, artificial birds should fly around in a mesmerizing dance. The simulation is very simple, it only containing 3 rules: alignment, cohesion and separation.</p>
                <p>Every concept in this page can be implemented however you want, that's why all code-snippets will be in C-like pseudocode. It will be your job to interpret my code and implement it yourself. No copy pasting! I will try my best to make it seem as easy as possible, but you're always allowed optimize and improve.</p>
                <p>Prerequisite knowledge includes:</p>
                <li>Graphics Programming - You will need to know how to render basic shapes. So programs like Processing, Unity, Pygame, etc... Or more low level methods like OpenGL and DirectX.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Vectors - If you've ever programmed a video-game before, chances are you've dealt with vectors. Though the vector math we'll be doing isn't too complicated, so don't worry too much!</li>
                <br>
                <li>Programming - duhh!</li>

                <h2>2.0 How I Did It</h2>
                <hr class="separator" style="background-color: rgb(68, 69, 86)">
                <p>A while back, I had programmed a Boids simulation for my robotics class' end-of-year project. I did it using Processing 3.5.4. Though I was proud of it, there were a few tiny bugs that bothered me. At the time, I didn't know how to fix them.</p>
                <p>Then recently, I decided to reprogram my Boids simulation with the intent on fixing all those pesky bugs. However, this time, I wanted to challenge myself. That's why I decided to program everything with OpenGL, in C. I chose C over C++ because I find the expirience more enjoyable. You can view my project on this page's <a href="https://github.com/SeeleyLogan/Boids", target="_blank">GitHub Repository.</a></p>
                <p>This is my first proper OpenGL and C program, so don't expect anything too fancy.</p>
